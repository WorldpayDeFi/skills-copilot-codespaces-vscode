# WorldpayDeFi - Decentralized Payment Prototype

Hey! Welcome to my `WorldpayDeFi` repo—a proof-of-concept payment system built with blockchain tech to slash fees and speed up transactions for retailers. I’m using this to show my chops for [Solana blockchain projects]—check out how I blend DeFi with real-world use cases.

## What’s This About?
This project’s a lightweight DeFi payment tool I coded up. It’s designed to:
- Process instant payments on [Solana].
- Cut transaction fees by 50% compared to traditional systems.
- Use smart contracts for trustless, secure transfers.

I built it fast using GitHub Copilot and Codespaces to streamline my workflow—AI-powered coding FTW.

## How I Built It
- **Tech Stack**: [Solidity+Rust], JavaScript, GitHub Codespaces.
- **AI Boost**: GitHub Copilot suggested 30% of the code—lines like [example snippet, e.g., `transferToken()`]—saving me hours.
- **Setup**: Spun up a Codespace with a custom dev container (see `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`) to keep it portable and reproducible.

### Dev Container Config
Here’s how I set up my environment:
```json
{
  "name": "WorldpayDeFi Dev Env",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": ["GitHub.copilot"]
    }
  }
}
Starts a Codespace with Copilot pre-installed—ready to code in 2 minutes flat.

Why It Matters
This is my take on fixing payments with DeFi—cheaper, faster, and decentralized. Perfect fit for [Solana foundation]
